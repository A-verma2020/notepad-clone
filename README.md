## The app serves following features

  - Write notes which then saved to the [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
  - Works and fetches notes offline-capable thanks to ServiceWorker.
  - "Add To Home Screen" feature on Android supported devices to launch the app from home screen.
